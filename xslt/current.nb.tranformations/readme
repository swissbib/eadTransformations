This directory contains three transformation-files, which are largely identical:
- transform.nb.foto.v04-S.vit.xsl : transforms all Photographs of the Schwarzenbach-collection with a digitzed image that was actually shot by Annemarie Schwarzenbach.
- transform.nb.foto.v04.vit.xsl : transforms all other photo-collections of HelveticArchives
- transform.nb.bild.v04.vit.xsl : transforms all other picture-collections of HelveticArchives



===============================
= transform.nb.foto.v04.vit.xsl
===============================
The different collections and the assigned copyright-status can be defined by adding two variables to the xsl while processing it:

- institutioncode
- rights949z

Both have a hardcoded fallback-code in the xsl-file
